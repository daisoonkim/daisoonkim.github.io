I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at North Carolina State University and a Research Economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. I am also affiliated with the Global Linkages Lab at Brown University. Prior to joining NC State, I was a Research Fellow at London Business School (2018–2019). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Washington in 2019.
