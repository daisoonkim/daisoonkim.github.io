    Projects:
      - name: Granular Data and Firm Dynamics (Isolating Synchronized Idiosyncratic Shocks)
        summary: Aggregate Fluctuations from Firm Comovement (R&R JME)
        highlights:
          - [Data Structure] Constructed a comprehensive 40-year longitudinal dataset covering the U.S. public firms (Compustat Fundamentals), cleaning and harmonizing sector classifications across decades to ensure consistency.
          - [Identification Strategy] Developed a non-parametric approach to decompose aggregate volatility. Unlike standard demeaning methods which wash out heterogeneity, this method isolates contribution of firm-specific shocks.
          - [Economic Insight] Demonstrated that 10-15 percent of aggregate volatility stems from correlated idiosyncratic shocks, challenging standard representative firm assumptions.

      - name: Multi-Source Data Integration and Supply Chain Network Analysis
        summary: Global Connectedness and Diversification during the Pandemic (R&R JMCB)
        highlights:
          - [Data Engineering] Engineered a high-dimensional linked panel by merging FactSet Revere (supply chain relationships), Compustat (balance sheets), and CRSP (daily stock returns).
          - [Identification Strategy] Exploited the exogenous timing of COVID-19 lockdowns across different countries to create a Difference-in-Differences (DID) design.
          - [Analysis] Mapped the propagation of supply chain shocks through specific firm-to-firm linkages.
          - [Result] Proved that while global diversification buffers domestic shocks, it exposes firms to specific foreign supplier risks---a finding only visible through granular network mapping.

      - name: Quasi-Experimental Design and Policy Evaluation
        summary: Public Information on Overseas Buyers for Export Promotion
        highlights:
          - [Data Engineering] Digitized and structured historical archives of KOTRA buyer contact releases to create a unique dataset of information provision. Merged with establishment and industry level datasets.
          - [Identification Strategy] Utilized a Quasi-Experimental Design, exploiting variation in the timing and industry-targeting of government information releases to establish causality.
          - [Economic Insight] Found that reducing information frictions significantly increases export volumes at the extensive margin (new buyers), particularly for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) in less concentrated industries.

      - name: High-Dimensional Scanner Data and Dynamic Discrete Choice
        summary: Consumer Learning and Package Size in Dynamic Brand Choice
        highlights:
          - [Data Structure] Analyzed Nielsen Scanner Data, handling millions of transaction-level observations to track household purchasing histories over multiple years.
          - [Econometric Challenge] Disentangling true preference learning from spurious state dependence (habit formation) in consumer panel data.
          - [Result] Quantified how information friction drives brand-purchasing behavior, providing micro-evidence that consumers use small package sizes to test new products before committing to bulk purchases.
