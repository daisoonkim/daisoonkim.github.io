    abstract = {This paper shows that correlated idiosyncratic fluctuations within industries are an important source of macroeconomic volatility. Standard methods, such as cross-sectional demeaning, obscure this channel by mechanically driving average pairwise correlations toward zero asymptotically. We develop a non-parametric bounds approach that quantifies the contribution of such clustered comovement directly from firm-level data. Applied to U.S. firms, we find that within-industry comovement explains 10–15\% of GDP volatility in normal times, 15–30\% in downturns, and up to 45\% during the Great Recession, helping account for the Great Moderation. These findings highlight the importance of cross-firm interdependencies in business cycle fluctuations.}

    abstract = {This paper examines how economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in host and competing countries reshapes U.S. multinationals’ greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI). Using firm-destination level data from 2003 to 2021, we show that while host-country EPU deters investment, EPU in competing destinations attracts it through a spillover effect. We document a structural shift around 2015: as global EPU rose unevenly, the spillover effect from competitors became the dominant driver of investment decisions, supplanting the direct effect of host-country uncertainty. Our findings indicate that in an era of heightened global risk, FDI allocation is governed by relative, not just absolute, policy stability.}

    abstract = {We study how a firm’s global connectedness through supply chains and exports affects its stock market performance during crises, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment. While global connectedness can transmit negative foreign shocks, it can also reduce susceptibility to domestic shocks by enabling international diversification. Combining weekly global stock market data with firm-level supply chain, export, and balance sheet information, we document a dual role of global connectedness. While firms' global supply chain and export networks expose firms to the negative impact of foreign COVID-19 outbreaks, firms with higher global connectedness are also more resilient to domestic exposures. Consistent with a diversification mechanism, the buffering effect arises only when connected foreign economies faced smaller outbreaks than the domestic economy. We further show that this diversification motive led firms to reorganize their supply chains and export networks, reallocating toward less-affected regions to mitigate the negative impact of pandemic shocks.}

    abstract = {South Korea faces persistently low fertility rates and large gender gaps in labor supply. Under traditional gender roles, more generous parental leave makes it difficult to narrow gender gaps while increasing fertility. To examine how recent reforms operate beyond these static channels, we develop a dynamic, heterogeneous-household life-cycle model in which couples jointly choose careers, labor supply, savings, childcare, and fertility. The model is calibrated to recent Korean cohorts and incorporates Korea’s segmented labor market, where career-oriented jobs are inflexible and involve high entry costs. Our quantitative results show that generous parental leave benefits can raise fertility and reduce gender gaps in labor supply and wages over the life cycle. These dynamic effects arise because parental leave job protection allows more women to remain in career-oriented jobs during childrearing years, enabling long-term career progression. Without job protection or segmented markets, this career-retention channel weakens and policy effects diminish or reverse.}
